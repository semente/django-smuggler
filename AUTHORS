Smuggler was originally created in 2010 by

  * Guilherme Gondim (semente) <semente at taurinus.org>.

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH APPRECIATED
CONTRIBUTORS --- people who have submitted patches, reported bugs,
added translations and generally made Smuggler much better:

  * Lachie Cox <lachiec at gmail.com>
  * Jaap Roes <jaap@eight.nl>

Thanks to Interaction Consortium <http://interactionconsortium.com/> for
sponsoring the project.
