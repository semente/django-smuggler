**Django Smuggler** is a pluggable application for `Django Web Framework`_ to
easily dump/load fixtures via the automatically-generated administration
interface. A fixture is file with model data serialized to e.g. JSON or XML
that Django knows how to import to the database.

Smuggler is especially useful for transporting database data between production
and development environments, but can also be used as a backup tool.

Installing & Setup
==================

Smuggler is in the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`_ and you can easily install
the latest stable version of it using the tools ``pip`` or
``easy_install``. Try::

  pip install django-smuggler

or::

  easy_install django-smuggler

.. _`Python Package Index (PyPI)`: http://pypi.python.org

Alternatively, you can install Smuggler from source code running the follow
command on directory that contains the file ``setup.py``::

  python setup.py install

After installation you need configure your project to recognizes the Smuggler
application adding ``'smuggler'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and setup
the project *URLConf* like follow::

  urlpatterns = [
      # ...
      path('admin/', include('smuggler.urls')),  # before admin url patterns!
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
  ]

Then try access these urls:

* `/admin/load/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/load/>`_, to load data from uploaded
  files or files on SMUGGLER_FIXTURE_DIR;

* `/admin/dump/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/dump/>`_, to download data from
  whole project;

  You can also pass in a querystring like
  ``/admin/dump/?app_label=flatpages,auth,yourapp.model`` to specify what
  must be dumped.

* `/admin/APP_LABEL/dump/ <http://127.0.0.1/admin/APP_LABEL/dump/>`_, to
  download data from a app;

* `/admin/APP_LABEL/MODEL_LABEL/dump/
  <http://127.0.0.1/admin/APP_LABEL/MODEL_LABEL/dump/>`_, to download data
  from a model;

If you can access the URLs above, the application was setup correctly. Note
that these URLs are accessible only by superusers.

Smuggler also provides a template to show buttons for dump and load data on
change list page (``change_list.html``). You can setup the ModelAdmin you are
interested like follow::

    class ExampleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        change_list_template = 'smuggler/change_list.html'
        ...


Settings
--------

Smuggler has the following settings available. You can set them in your project
``settings.py``. If you doesn't set them it will assume the default values:

SMUGGLER_EXCLUDE_LIST
    List of models to be excluded from dump. Use the form 'app_label.ModelName'.
    Default: [].

SMUGGLER_FIXTURE_DIR
    Uploaded fixtures are stored in this directory (if requested).
    Default: None.

SMUGGLER_FORMAT
    Format for dumped files. Any of the serialization formats supported by
    Django, json, xml and in some cases yaml.
    Default: 'json'.

SMUGGLER_INDENT
    Indentation for dumped files.
    Default: 2.
